What is documented information? - Definitions and references
The term Documented information was introduced as part of the common High Level Structure(HLS) and common terms for Management System Standards (MSS).
The definition of documented information can be found in ISO 9000 clause 3.8. Documented information can be used to communicate a message, provide evidence of what has actually been done of what was planned, or knowledge sharing.
The following are some of the main objectives of an organization’s documented information independent of whether
or not it has implemented a formal QMS;
a) Communication of Information
	- As a tool for information transmission and communication. The type and extent of the documented information will depend on the nature of the organization’s products and processes, the degree of formality of communication systems and the level of communication skills within the organization, and the organizational culture.
b) Evidence of conformity
	- Provision of evidence that what was planned has actually been done.
c) Knowledge sharing
d) To disseminate and preserve the organization’s experiences. A typical example would be a technical specification, which can be used as a base for design and development of a new product or service. 
A list of commonly used terms and definitions relating to documented information is presented in ISO 9001:2015 Annex A.
It must be stressed that, according to ISO 9001:2015 clause 7.5.3 Control of documented information requirements, documents may be in any form or type of medium, and the definition of “document” in ISO 9000:2015 clause 3.8.5 gives the following examples:
- paper
- magnetic
- electronic or optical computer disc
- photograph
- master sample
